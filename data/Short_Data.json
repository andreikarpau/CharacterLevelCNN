Mae Ploy makes both of these tasks quite easy to accomplish. The very best curry is made from making one's own paste, however finding the time and perhaps even more difficult, the ingredients to do so does not compensate for the difference in taste. In my experience, Mae Ploy is an excellent green curry paste that tastes plenty fresh and will give you that same satisfaction that you get from a Thai restaurant.A few things I've learned using their curry pastes over the years:1) If you are cooking for people who are not used to Thai food, the proportions indicated in the directions on the container will be WAY TOO HOT for them. This is especially true with Green Curry and even more important if there will be children eating the meal. It's very easy to adjust the amount of paste used, and with practice you'll learn just how much is good for the experienced palate and how much is good for kids or newbies.2) The packaging doesn't mention anything about how long the product keeps. The paste comes in a plastic container with a lid that can seal, but it's actually in a thick plastic bag inside that container. I used to cut open the bag and leave it in the container, but I've taken to just cutting a hole in the corner and using it like an icer would in a bakery. I feel like the double container might help it to keep a bit longer. Once the bag is opened, the product should be stored in the refrigerator. There is enough in the container to make several curry dishes.3) Mae Ploy paste is fantastic, but choosing a bad coconut milk can degrade the quality of your dish or even ruin it altogether. Don't go with \"lite\" brands, and look for something more authentic if you can find it. I've found Chaokoh brand comes with a higher amount of cream which gives your curry a more consistent flavor. Chaokoh is the brand most often found in Asian markets and I've always figured that they would know best.This product is incredibly easy to use and turns out a Green Curry that will make your friends think yours is good as a restaurant's. I don't believe there is a better paste on the market and when you factor in the price it's a no brainer.

However, I will say that this is a much better than average tasting sports bar/snack (name your preference), free of the cardboad-ish and stale texture and barely identifiable aftertastes common to similar products.While noone will compare this to a real apple crisp, this convenient food for those on the go has recognizable tastes of oats (this flavor and texture predominates), apple, and cinnamon, due in large part, I suspect, to the fact that it actually contains those ingredients!

I enjoyed the flavor and it managed to fill me up in place of a regular breakfast.  I didn't get hungry until at least three hours later (and for me that is actually pretty good, I'm always hungry).The main flavor of this bar was the peanut butter. The chocolate barely made an appearance and that was just fine for me.  It was just a surprise here and there when you hit a chip.  The bar was chewy, but not really crunchy from the oats and other grains and fibers that were included in the bar.  It was sweet, and that's to be expected from the sweeteners of brown rice syrup, honey, evaporated can juice syrup and the chocolate chips.  Lots of sweeteners in here making the bar content of sugar 18 grams.  So that is something to watch.The rest of the ingredients were good.  There's whole oats, rice flour, and other pronounceable ingredients throughout.  And a whole list of minerals and vitamins is included so it's even somewhat nutritional for you.  But there are a lot of allergens here as well, as is obvious by the peanut butter flavor.  And another thing of note is that this bar packs a walloping 240 calories.  So use it as a meal replacement or for during vigorous exercise as opposed to a snack.  It would definitely be a good bar for a hiking trip.I liked it and will probably consider it again for breakfast.

She took one look at my coffee-making operation and shook her head in disbelief. I needed a high-end coffeemaker. This just wouldn't do!

It was good equipment and made a good cup of coffee, although the cost of the equipment was over 7 times that of my Melitta and the coffee wasn't as good. Plus, the equipment had to be meticulously cleaned and that quickly turned into an onerous task. My old Melitta was relegated to camping duties and finally lost.Well, my wife is now gone. And I was about to clean the Cuisineart Coffeemaker for the umpteenth time. I came up with the brilliant idea of going back to a Melitta. Good move! They were still around. I couldn't spot them in stores, but they were available on Amazon. What a neat gadget! I used it this morning and the coffee tasted so good! And it was so simple!

I find the system more convenient than coffee machines.> If the power goes off, you can still make coffee if you have a gas stove or a camp stove.> It is easy to brew  exactly the amount of coffee you want, and exactly the strength that you want---including adjusting to new roast and grinds. You can even mix caffeinated and decaffeinated coffees if you wish.> In a way, the Mellita system is more \"sanitary\". It is easy to forget a used filter in a coffee maker, maybe for weeks if you go on a vacation, and find a fungus garden in there. You can't ignore a used Melitta filter, because it is out in the open. If you forget a used Melitta filter, it and the coffee grinds just dry out.  It is also much easier to wash the Melitta components---just a quick rinse under the tap is usually good enough.  Caveat--some types of coffee are oiler than others---you may need to actually wash your cone and carafe if a quick rinse is not sufficient.SIZE OPTIONSThe carafes for which the \"6 cup\" and \"10 cup\" systems can nominally hold 6 or 10 cups off coffee (filled to the brim), but that is really irrelevant.  A more important consideration is cups vs mugs.  How many people still drink \"cups\" of coffee?  So, it is the \"mug-capacity\" (1 mug = 1 1/2 cups) of the filters and cones which really counts.#2 filters/conesRecomemnded: 1 cupPractical Maximum: 1 mugTheoretical Maximum: 2 cups#4 filters/cones (\"6 cup system\")Recommended: 1-2 mugsPractical Maximum:  2 1/2 mugsTheoretical Maximum: 4 mugs#6 filters/cones (\"10 cup system\")Recommended: 2-3 mugsPractical Maximum: 4 mugsTheoretical Maximum: 6 mugsHowever, I don't follow my own recommendation:  In the morning, I want coffee \"now!\"  I often run out of patience trying to brew even 1 mug of coffee using #4 filter/cones.  On the other hand, the #6 filter/cones holds a whole mug of hot water in one quick pour, and drains about as fast as you can continue to pour the water in---so I find it very convenient for brewing 1 to 2 mugs of coffee at a time, and on rare occasions to easily brew 4 mugs (6 cups) of coffee.  However, in this case, the hot water has little time to extract the flavor from the coffee.  To compensate, I grind my coffee very finely.  I could simply use more coffee, but that would be wasteful.The #6 filters/cones (\"10-cup system\") is faster and more flexible, at a slightly higher cost for the filters.Melitta Cone Filter Coffeemaker 10 Cup, 1-CountIf you are patient and your space is very limited, such as in a camper, boat, or in a college dorm, or if you really want only 1 or 2 mugs of coffee at a time, #4 filter/cones (the so-called \"6 cup system\") is a good choice.GRINDS OF COFFEEIf you usually brew the \"recommended\" or fewer number of mugs of coffee, then very-finely ground coffee is recommended. If you usually brew the the \"recommended\" or more number of mugs at a time, then a medium grind coffee may work best.  Most supermarket \"fine grind\" is actually a medium grind.  If you brew more than the \"practical maximum\" a medium-coarse grind will work better.  If you grind your own coffee in an electric grinder, \"coarse\" is only a second or two, medium-fine is perhaps 10 seconds, and very fine is perhaps 30 seconds, until the pitch of the sound changes, indicating that no more grinding is taking place.REUSEIf you use very-fine grind, then discard the used filter when finished (because most of the flavor will be extracted, and the filter will be clogged up by the fine grinds).  If you use a medium grind, then you can optionally reuse the grinds in the afternoon to make a second batch of coffee (which will be lower in caffeine).  Coffee-freaks may object to reusing grinds, but it works just fine.FORMULARegardless of the grind, you have to use the same formula for the TOTAL amount of coffee actually made, i.e., 1 to 2 tablespoons of ground coffee per mug, depending on your taste, brand, etc.FILTERSPresumably, brown filters are easier on the environment---and on you, less chemicals having been used to manufacture them.  Unfortunately, #6 filters are hard to find in most grocery stores, but easy to purchase via Amazon.Melitta Cone Coffee Filters, Natural Brown, No. 6, 40-Count Filters (Pack of 12)Melitta Cone Coffee Filters, Natural Brown, No. 2, 100-Count Filters (Pack of 6)Melitta Cone Coffee Filters, White, No. 6, 40-Count Filters (Pack of 12)In an emergency, you can use #4 filters in a #6 cone, but you'll regret it (having been spoiled by the convenience of #6 filters).RECOMMENDATIONS ON MAKING GOOD COFFEE>>Use fresh unchlorinated water if possible.  Do not use \"softened\", \"sparkling\", or \"mineral\" water.  If you let an open pitcher of water sit on a counter for a few hours (or overnight), most of the chlorine will evaporate.  The best way to get pure water is a reverse-osmosis system.  Bring the water to a quick boil, but don't leave it boiling too long--that will flush out the dissolved oxygen, leaving the coffee tasting flat.>>There is a huge difference between brands and roasts.  Experiment and enjoy.  However, even more important is freshness---which is the greatest challenge.  How can you know if the coffee is fresh?  The easiest way is to signup with a service such as Gavelia, Boca Java, or Coffee Bean Direct--whose only business is providing you with freshly roasted (and freshly-ground if you wish) coffee.>>Particularly if you do not use a \"coffee service\", its best to buy whole beans and grind them just before brewing.  A $15 grinderKrups 203-42 Fast Touch Coffee Grinder, Blackis as good as a $200 grinder. It takes only a few seconds to grind a batch of coffee while waiting for the water to boil.>>For newbies, \"French\" or \"dark roast\" coffee is rich and bitter, and usually brewed \"strong\".  Light roasts are more complex, but some are acidic, and are usually brewed and drank more like tea.  Light roast Indonesian coffee is particularly complex.  Caveat, \"complex\" does not necessarily mean flavorful---some dark roasts are wonderful, but it is probably harder to find a good dark roast.  TheCoffee Bean Direct Assorted Whole Bean Coffee Sampler, 9-Pound Boxavailable from Amazon is a good way to explore the varieties of coffee.>>The filter cone and carafe should be rinsed off after every use, otherwise your coffee can be contaminated with stale oils. A weekly wash in the dishwasher won't hurt.>>Elsewhere, you'll read endless nonsense about the exact water temperature, how fast or how slow to pour the water, the value of porcelain vs plastic cones, preheating the cones with hot water, how finely ground the coffee should be, etc.  It's all nonsense (except possibly to engineers who design coffeemakers). 99% of what matters is the quality of the ingredients: water and coffee.  You want fresh oxygenated chlorine-free salt-free water, and good quality recently-roasted and recently-ground coffee.SAFETYIt is easy to forget the glass carafe on a hot stove.  I broke at least 6 carafes before I purchased a whistling teakettle.Revere 2-1/3-Quart Whistling Tea KettleNEVER use the carafe to boil water or reheat coffee.  The flood of water might crack a ceramic stovetop, or put out a the flame of a gas stove---both causing catastrophic problems.  Use your microwave to reheat (1 mug of coffee = 30-45 seconds); it's faster and safer.It is important to take care to pour the boiling water into the filter, not between the filter and the filter cone. It is any easy accident to make. To minimize such accidents, fold over the \"joined\" edges of the filters so that the filter opens wider. If you are a particular klutz, a quick rinse with a little cold water before you add the ground coffee can \"glue\" the filter to the cone.SUGAR IN YOUR COFFEE?Purist insist that coffee should always be drank black.  While I tentatively agree, I can't.  My taste-buds are overly sensitive to bitterness.  However, I have found that pure SteviaPure Stevia Extract Powder by Kal - 3.5 ozis a good replacement for sugar for me.  Oddly, it isn't as sweet as sugar, but is just as effective in cutting the bitterness, which is what I really need.  Truvia and other brands in packets or described as \"spoonable\" contain bulking agents which effect the flavor and leave a yucky residue, and are comparatively expensive.  KAL Pure Stevia contains no bulking agents and is very economical.SALT IN YOUR COFFEE?It's a naval tradition.  I've found that a few grains of sea-salt in a cup of light-roast coffee can be pleasant, but not so compelling that I make a habit of it.  However, a little salt is more noticeable (in a good way) in ice coffee.MILK IN YOUR COFFEE?If the purpose is just to cut the acidity, then you need to try a different coffee or brewing method.  If the purpose is to cut the bitterness, you might want to try stevia instead.  If you simply like milk in your coffee---I say, indulge yourself with a little real (not fake) half-and-half, or even heavy cream.  I usually drink my coffee black with a little stevia, but for a rare desert cup, real sugar and real cream are essential.GENERAL SHOPPING RECOMMENDATIONAfter major grocery shopping expeditions, sit down at your computer with your receipt, and check if you can buy any of the non-perishables through Amazon. When you find items (even if more expensive than you just paid), put the item on your Amazon wish list, and add a note to the wish list of the price you just paid. Check your wish list frequently, and when you see an item you need at a bargain price, buy it.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Does the job", "unixReviewTime": 1307404800, "reviewTime": "06 7, 2011"}

The problem, the espresso machines would scale up and either need cleaning (descaling) or blow the safety valve in the lid and be rendered useless.  We have gone through countless steam espresso machines over the years and spent many a Saturday (yes, the whole day) soaking the espresso machine in descaling solution and then cleaning the descaling solution out of the espresso machine so the first cup in the morning, wouldn't taste like descaling solution.Well, we can no longer find.....anywhere, basic steam espresso machines as all we can find are fancy espresso machines that will quickly clog up with scale or drip coffee makers that churn out weak, watery coffee shop style coffee.....\"More coffee hun?\"  Do you really want to know?Enters this drip carafe as I tried making drip coffee out of a paper towel and a strainer and found the coffee to be acceptable but still a bit bitter and not up to par.  I ordered up this carafe with six hundred #4 filters at less than one-third the cost of what a replacement steam espresso coffee maker would have cost, based upon the last purchase price of eighty dollars US.Yes, it's a bit of a \"BIG\" pain to make a carafe of coffee.  The water needs to be heated in a microwave, two cups at a time for four minutes and then slowly drizzled over the fresh grinds until all the water has been allowed to drain through the filter.  This needs to be done twice, using three heaping teaspoons of fresh ground, French Roast, coffee beans, in each of two filter baskets.The good, now that's what I'm talking about!  The resulting coffee is fresh, thick, robust, smooth, full flavor, that's what I'm talking about, coffee.  The point, if you care about your coffee and how it tastes, for the effort, this is for you.  We drink our coffee black and do not find need to add creams, sugars or otherwise to make it palpable as we like our coffee in the morning, just as it is, perfectly black.An aside, we buy filters, six hundred filters at a time.  We use three to four filters each morning as we brew up coffee at the rate of sixteen ounces per three heaping teaspoons of fresh ground coffee, per filter.  Doing the math, this is about a six month supply of coffee filters.If you're looking for convenience, dash and go, this is not for you.  If you're looking to have fresh, smooth, robust coffee in the morning and don't mind the hassle it takes to get what you want, this package is definitely for you.---------------------Addendum:I like this combination so much that today, 10Aug13, I purchased a second pot/filter cone combination.  FYI, the coffee is the best morning coffee we've had.  We are very happy with the coffee this hand pour drip system makes.  It's a bit slow working with a single filter cone so in a few days, we'll have a second pot/filter cone to speed the morning coffee making process up.

I find the system more convenient than coffee machines.If the power goes off, you can still make coffee if you have a gas stove or a camp stove.It is easy to brew exactly the amount of coffee you want, and exactly the strength that you want---including adjusting to new roast and grinds.  You can even mix caffeinated and decaffeinated coffees if you wish.  I often re-use the morning's grinds in the afternoon, by adding a spoon of decaffeinated coffee.  That is not recommended with an automatic coffee machine---because if you clog up the filter, the boiling water could overflow.  No problem clogging up a Melitta filter, if it drains slowly, then pour slowly.In a way, the Mellita system is more \"sanitary\".  It is easy to forget a used filter in a coffee maker, maybe for weeks if you go on a vacation, and find a fungus garden in there.  You can't ignore a used Melitta filter, because it is out in the open.  If you forget a used Melitta filter, it and the coffee grinds just dry out.Although most people use smaller Mellita filters and cones, I prefer the large #6 system.  The #6 system (filters, cone, and caraf) is intended for brewing 4-8 cups at a time.  However, the larger filter holds more water, and it drains faster, so you can brew 2 cups of coffee with a #6 filter faster than with a #4 filter.  So the #6 system is faster and more flexible, at a very slightly higher cost for the filters.If you grind your own coffee, the water (for 1-2 cups) is almost boiling by the time you've set up the filter, ground the coffee, and put away the coffee grinder.  A #6 filter actually holds the water for about 2 cups of coffee, but drains so fast that pouring 4-8 cups of water through just takes perhaps 10--15 seconds.  The corresponding #6 glass carafe is marked for up to 8 cups, but obviously it takes longer to boil the water for 8 or so cups of coffee.It's as simple as it gets, the price of the filters is cheap, and the quality of the results as terrific.  What else could you want?Presumably, brown filters are easier on the environment---and on you, less chemicals having been used to manufacture them.The specific Amazon product is probably the cheapest way to purchase the preferred filters.NOTEIt is important to take care to pour the boiling water into the filter, not between the filter and the filter cone.

I love the way the spicy heat builds and spreads, and the subtle and not-so-subtle flavors that you can taste. Also, it is salty enough to use as a substitute for salt the same way you would with soy sauce or a fish sauce.A little goes a long way, and especially if you are counting calories, fat or sodium intake. A serving is about a teaspoon - more than enough to mix into rice or drizzle over other dishes - and it comes in at 90 calories. That same serving contains 9 grams of fat and 440mg of sodium. So, do use sparingly if you are watching any of those nutritional factors.Another thing that I personally love is this is unfiltered. There are pieces of peppers and other ingredients that will suspend in the oil if you vigorously shake the jar before serving. Those add a lot to the flavor profile, which is predominately salty and piquant (and there is also a distinct element of umami).If you love spicy sauces and oils and want to 'spice' up your meal (pun intended) this is an excellent infused oil that will do the trick.

I told her to send it back if there's anything wrong with it, but she said no, it is PERFECT.  Knowing my mom, she would have told me if it wasn't.UPDATE:  I've had three trees sent as gifts to family and they have been an absolute hit!

They will offer you insanely hot sauces, that aren't really sauces because they're simply pure extract.  Anyone can make extract that'll make your rectum erupt, but to make a sauce that is actually flavorful is the kicker.  The closest sauce to Dave's Insanity would probably be After Death.  The spice level is pretty similar, but Blair's has a grainy, almost sandy texture to it that kind of eats away at your palette.

It's one of those sauces that you can put a little on a toothpick and watch someone's face light up as the heat arrives.  So when I saw that Dave's had a Ghost Pepper based sauce I was excited to see just what it was going to bring to the table.  The answer is pure smokey heat.The first time I tried it I was very sparing with it, putting just a couple of drops on a few slices of pizza and spreading them out.  The result was that I could taste the heat but not really the flavor of the sauce.  The next time I decided to just sprinkle 8 to 10 drops of the sauce over a few slices and I got the full throttled effect.  The sauce is hot, make no mistake about that.  It starts out hot and continues to linger, allowing each additional bite to add to the burn.  A nice greasy, cheesy pizza is the perfect delivery method as the fats in the cheese try to keep your tongue from burning up, but to no avail as it is just temporary relief.  I found each bite to get hotter and the sweat started to pour.  The amazing thing to me was that even with the heat level I was still enjoying the taste of the pizza and the sauce.The bottom line is if you like hot sauce HOT, this is good stuff.

Wherever you placed the toothpick will temporarily feel like you actually burned it there. Yeah, its hot!Please know what you are getting into if you buy this. It is a sauce with extract in it and is VERY hot. The especially sneaky part is that the temperature creeps up on you and takes a few minutes to really kick.

I only recently bought a \"hottest sauce\" while at a kind of flea market in England. It was also a ghost pepper sauce and i was shocked at the intensity of the burn. At first I was sort of proud of myself for being able to use it, but it did grow on me and I started using it as an actual condiment.  After the bottle ran out I thought I would see what was on Amazon and this sauce was ranked very highly so I bought it. So I really only have one other sauce to compare this to but here goes:The sauce is very hot. Almost too hot. It has a pasty consistency, almost exactly like tomato paste. Very finely ground. It has a more gummy consistency to it, like theres something added to it to give it a smoother texture though there's no such actual ingredient.What there is, however, as someone else pointed out, is pepper extract. It's the second listed ingredient so there must be a considerable amount. Perhaps it's what's giving this sauce that slimy texture I was eluding to earlier. This Pepper Extract doesn't state what KIND of pepper, and as it's an extract I imagine it must have gone through quite the extraction process.So what I'm getting at is this: the sauce feels more like a pepper extract, something which you should add small amounts of to large dishes for adding pure spice to the food. But it's missing the taste and feel of an actual hot sauce. There's little flavor, just a lot of burn. And I have to say that that's a big shame because the bhut jolokia pepper is very tasty. Almost fruity if I remember correctly.So I give this hot sauce 4 stars for the Effort and the level of spice, but I won't give it 5 stars because I think that goes to the generic bhut jolokia ghost pepper sauces with all the scary names and pictures on the bottle. The one I had was Fear Hot Sauce with a scary ghost woman on it, and it was much more like salsa, with little ground up pieces of ghost peppers and seeds in it and equal to, if not more burn than this one.If I change my mind as I go through this bottle, I'll update or comment on here again.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Kick to it", "unixReviewTime": 1320278400, "reviewTime": "11 3, 2011"}

Now it is the Naga Jolokia (also known as the Naga Morris, Nai Miris, Bih Jolokia and Bhut Jolokia, etc.) with a whopping 1,001,304  Scoville Heat Units according to the New Mexico State University Chile Pepper Institute. In February 2007, Guinness World Records certified the Bhut Jolokia (aka Naga Jolokia) as the hottest pepper in the world.  It is reportedly called the \"Ghost Pepper\" because after one bite of the pepper you \"give up the ghost\".Now Dave's Gourmet has made a sauce from this serious pepper.  This is nothing to fool around with, it will cause pain, a lot of pain.  So why would anybody want a sauce that hot (other than for bravado)?  I for one like the taste.  It is a little smokier that Habanero.  I also use it in sauces where I want heat but not the red color of chili peppers, such as a cream based sauce.  Since it only takes a drop to give me the heat that I want it will hardly change the color of a white sauce.My only reservations about it is that it contains hot pepper extract (which is what they call the stuff that they spray in the eyes of criminals).  I've seen hot pepper extract for sale as a commercial additive.  It's low on flavor but big on heat.  Was this added to give the sauce extra pain inducing heat while using fewer actual Jolokia peppers? I don't know but it makes you think.

Maltitol is an alcohol sugar and can be undigestible in the body.  You will know a short time after consuming it if you are one of the unsuspecting many who cannot digest it by the extreme intestinal bloating and cramping and massive amounts of gas a person can experience. Nausea, diarrhea & headaches can also be experienced. I learned my lesson the hard way years ago when I fell in love with the sugar-free chocolates suzanne sommers used to sell.  I thought I'd found sugar-free chocolate nirvana at first taste but the bliss was short lived when the terrible side effects of maltitol kicked in.  The discomfort was unlike anything I had ever felt before.  I blew up like a balloon and had very painful abdominal cramping.  As the symptoms passed, this too was very unpleasant.  Though hard for me to believe a low calorie sweetener could be the culprit, all symptoms were gone when I stopped eating the chocolate. My hunch it had something to do with the maltitol were unfortunately confirmed for me about a year later when I purchased some delicious sugar-free popcorn at my local market.  The taste was amazing and while I was looking at the label wondering what could possibly make this yummy, new sugarfree treat taste so good, my heart sank when I followed the little asterisk next to sugarfree sweetener* down to the very bottom of the label and read \"maltitol\" in tiny little letters! Thank goodness I'd eaten only a little. I still ended up with all the same side-effects but for a much shorter duration.

Chicory, with sugar beet and rye was used as an ingredient of the East German Mischkaffee (mixed coffee), introduced during the \"coffee crisis\" of 1976-9.\" Chicory is also related to endive and raddichio.Cafe au lait is strong coffee mixed half with hot milk, and sugar added as desired.

We were hot, sweaty, and more than a little worn out from having hoofed all over the historic district. It would take more than a few Dunkin Donuts to revive our exausted, jaded spirits and a whole lot more than a Krispee Kream to skewer our skepticism.The pastries needed to be fresh, hot, and Paris-pretty to impress us. The coffee had to be perfectly percolated to perk us up.What we had that morning (several plates of steaming, sinfully-sweet, precisely-powdered beignets) were tiny pillows of pastry perfection. The beignets were so good, we made several more early morning trips to Cafe du Monde during our stay in New Orleans. The coffee was utterly addictive, strong, lovely, full-bodied, with a rich aroma that could be detected long before we entered the shop.Once home, I experienced a serious post-perfect-beignet let-down. Krispee Kream no longer cut it. Starbucks was sadly unsatisfying.I was thrilled when I discovered I could buy Cafe du Monde's beignet mix and coffeee online. I ordered several boxes and cans, stocked up on a truck-load of powdered sugar, and anxiously waited by my mailbox. When the much-coveted beignet mix was finally delivered, I wasted no time in firing up the oil and brewing a pot of coffee.I was very pleased with the beignet mix and the chicory coffee. The directions were easy to follow (just add water) and the amount of mix in the box was generous for the price. Once properlly prepared, the beignets were just as delicious as those served at Cafe du Monde (of course, you do have that tiresome clean-up when you make them at home that you don't have when you go to the cafe in New Orleans, but all truly great things come with a price).Pefect patries and heavenly coffee.

Therefore, if you want it to be super spicy, you need to dress it up a bit.  Follow the package instructions for best results but use a whisk.  It needs to be made in a saucepan on top of the stove or in a Mr. Coffee Cocomotion machine.Grind the cakes in advance for maximum convenience and use 1 and a half times the recommended amount for best results. Use whole milk for best results or 2%.  Skim milk just doesn't work as well. For a spicier mug of cocoa, add ground chili powder to taste.  You can also add a piece of vanilla bean while cooking if you like that.  If you want even more cinnamon taste, you can cook with a cinnamon stick. You can add espresso powder as well for a nice change of pace.

So these younger chiles are slightly less hot than then the older red ones.This is a pure heat source with little if any other flavor beyond the overwhelming heat.

While there are some very vague vinegar notes (from the Acetic Acid) -  there is no real character to this sauce beyond pure heat.A better choice would be the El Yucateco Extra Hot Habanero Sauce.

It isn't thin or overly vinegary or too salty though like a lot of hot sauces. I think this is because there is more actual habaneros in there because it's a little thicker consistency with a bit of fine texture to it.  Also, the color is fabulous.  I don't know if they add food dye or not but it is this vibrant, almost neon grass green.  Love it.My favorite way to eat it is on simple things like carne asada with flour tortillas, avocado and shredded lettuce, on 'over medium' fried eggs, and it's perfect on fish tacos with cool slaw, raw white onion and ranch.  The Mexican restaurant where I first had this doesn't have it on the tables anymore (probably because it's too hot for most) but they take it and puree it fine with avocado for this outrageously hot guacamole/habanero sauce thing that is just awesome.So obviously I love it and highly recommend it for experienced hot sauce people.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Addictive", "unixReviewTime": 1342051200, "reviewTime": "07 12, 2012"}

But I settled for trying to warm up.I've always heard that if you warm up on the inside, then the outside will follow. So I bought this bottle of El Yucateco and saved it for the next inevitable snowstorm. When I was done shoveling and still shivering, I opened it up and slammed it down the hatch -- all eight ounces.First, a few words about the taste: El Yucateco red has a nice tangy element, lingering through the forward habanero kick and beyond. The additional spices play well with the primary pepper, adding a savory depth that's more than just pure heat or capsaicin jolt. The tomato base and hearty thick texture promise a richness and complexity of flavor that is delivered quite nicely to the palate.And now, a few words about the unrelenting napalm burn that traveled around my mouth, down my gullet and -- over the next twelve hours or so -- into, through, and out my intestines, scorching and defiling every square millimeter of delicate insides that it touched: [...]Overall, I'd say this would make a very nice complement to a variety of Mexican or South American dishes, as well as grilled meats, starchy vegetables or as an extra kick to, say, garlicky green veggie side dishes.

I've been blind taste testing hot sauces for over 6 months. I have about 40 hot sauces in my house. I taste test them raw, and then with food; write up some notes and then a week or so later do the same thing again and then compare all my notes. I repeat this process again and again. Like I said: everyone needs a hobby. Frankly I wanted to settle on a few excellent brands because I love hot foods. So for about $75.00 I have a cabinet filled with hot sauces.The first thing that everyone needs to know is that a Chipotle based hot sauce is a sub-category within the hot sauce universe. The chipotle is a smoked jalape&ntilde;o&ntilde;o pepper, relatively mild and it has a rich, almost sweet flavor, and it is not that hot. I happen to love its taste but I have discovered there are a number of inferior sauces based on this pepper.The El Yucateco is at the very top of my list for this type of pepper. It has a rich smokey (almost sweet) flavor with some heat. Keep in mind, no chipotle based sauce has searing heat. This blend includes some sugar and even a bit of tomato. It's only competitor, according to my taste testing, would be Tabasco's Chipotle based sauce which is also excellent. Tabasco adds primarily vinegar to its blend while, as noted, El Yucateco adds sugar and tomato paste to theirs. Both seem a bit sweet and both have a low level of heat.  Either one of these brands is vastly superior to all the other Chipotle sauces I have taste tested.When you can find this sauce in stores, the average price is about $2.00FOR A COUPLE OF BUCKS YOU SHOULD TRY THIS ONE but watch out for Amazon sellers that offer a low price per bottle combined with high shipping charges, even when you order many bottles at the same time.Watch out for Amazon sellers that offer a low price but then charge a very high shipping charge on A PER BOTTLE BASIS. In other words, even if you order 6 bottles at the same time - a very high shipping charge will apply - based on the single bottle shipping rate. One way a SELLER can game the Amazon system is to offer a low price but correspondingly high shipping charges on a per bottle basis. Buyer beware!BEST BUY:El Yucateco Chipotle Hot Sauce, 5 FL OZ bottles (pack of 12) is your best buy at $30.00 with free shipping.

This sauce could or should be a staple in any kitchen.  I'm glad to have a bottle in my pantry.I would rate this sauce somewhere between mild and medium hot. You'll need more than a couple of drops but not much more than that to generate some heat in any dish. Compared to Tabasco's original you'll need about twice the number of drops.Ingredients (as copied from the label): Water, Red Peppers, Salt, Spices, Garlic, Acetic Acid (a component of vinegar), etc ......Note the relatively low level of vinegar within the sauce. That is a good thing. The type of red pepper is unknown but there is a natural sweetness to this sauce which I find quite pleasant. That sweetness balances nicely against the heat. View this sauce as a superior alternative to a very common benchmark - the original Tabasco hot sauce.Minor flaws: There is a bit too much salt in this sauce but that only becomes evident when used in an already heavily salted dish. For example: This is not the best choice for a Bloody Mary due to the heavily salted nature of most vegetable/tomato juices.Since this sauce is available in 5 oz, 10 oz and 32 oz sizes - you'd be wise to pick up the 32oz size given the fact that it often costs little more than the smaller sizes.This is a fine basic hot sauce with a natural sweetness to it.

Once you've used it, all other vanillas seem weak or watered down in comparison. I've been using this brand exclusively for at least 5 years now. However, I always order their Vanilla extract & didn't even realize they offered a 'paste'.I wasn't looking closely when I ordered this and was surprised when I opened this and found it was a thicker, gel-like substance. My first concern was \"will it taste as good?\" followed by \"what is being used to thicken this stuff?\". The taste seems pretty equivalent and according to the label, a tsp. of this is equal to a tsp. of their vanilla extract. The thickener used is Gum tragacanth, which if you wiki it shows as being a gum from a middle eastern tree.Personally, I'd prefer to cook with stuff that doesn't have added thickeners, colorings, artificial flavorings etc., so going forward I will be sure to check the label and order the extract. However, I didn't see anything about the gum tragacanth to make me want to toss this bottle out and not use it at all.I do not think this has better or more intense flavor than the Nielsen-Massey Vanilla extract although others here have claimed this. You do see the little bits of vanilla bean in the gel/paste, so if you like that \"look\" of vanilla bean specks in your ice cream, cake or whatever you're making then this will give you that. However, taste wise, it's not better plus you're adding a tree gum to your food.All-in-all I'll stick with the same brand vanilla extract going forward, but would be willing to order this paste again if their extract weren't available (because the taste of the Nielsen-Massey Madagascar Bourbon Vanilla is far superior to every other vanilla I've used in the past (including home-made).", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Accidentally ordered instead of the vanilla extract, it's ok but prefer their extract", "unixReviewTime": 1366675200, "reviewTime": "04 23, 2013"}

Early pioneers in pregnancy testing came up with the &#34;Friedman test.&#34;,  An improvement on the 1927 test developed by Bernhard Zondek and Selmar Aschheim that used mice (You can't sell dead mice on Amazon).  The rabbit test was an advance and consisted of injecting the tested woman's urine into a female rabbit. Examining the rabbit's ovaries a few days later you would find a change in response to a hormone only secreted by pregnant women. The hormone, human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), is produced during pregnancy and indicates the presence of a fertilized egg. The rabbit test became very popular and the supply of dead rabbits increased. The term &#34;rabbit test&#34; was first recorded in 1949 but became a common phrase in the English language. The people who didn't know any better thought the injected rabbit would die only if the woman was pregnant. The phrase &#34;the rabbit died&#34; became as euphemism for a positive pregnancy test. Actually all rabbits used for the test died, because they had to be surgically opened in order to examine the ovaries. While it was possible to do this without killing the rabbit, it was generally deemed not worth the trouble and expense, the cheapskates!  Due to medical advances, use of a live animal is no longer required. Folks the rabbits don't have to die. Don't promote their demise by purchasing this product.A replacement for the rabbit test uses frogs, specifically the African clawed frog, which like all frogs lays eggs instead of getting pregnant, and therefore can yield a positive result on the test without the need to be cut open in order to prove it.

They are small, so they're easy to store in a freezer and they don't contain enough dark energy in them to tear a hole in the thin fabric that separates our reality from the mystic aether when their tiny frames are shot through with eldritch magic and move not of their own accord but the will of my friend, who forges pacts in blood with long-forgotten dread gods.Zombie bunnies only eat vegetables so you don't need a helmet to protect your brain and 300 of them work just as well as any 50 regular zombies.A GREAT VALUE FOR ANY NECROMANCER", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Very Useful for Staying Out of The Forbidden Zone", "unixReviewTime": 1390608000, "reviewTime": "01 25, 2014"}

It is NOT fuzzy although it is pink....sorta. More like a greenish red color. There was a stench too!Now THIS after Hostess took away his twinkies (Amazon has been wheeling & dealing in $500 a box Twinkies, so they must be in cahoots with Hostess). This has contributed to his anxiety, which means MORE XANAX to tone that boy down. Very very hard for a 42 yr. old boy to deal with! He did say, however, that it DOES taste like chicken.
