Plenty of raw fruits (except banana) and vegetables (two raw carrots a day works wonders!)  Whole grains every day makes a big difference--I especially like brown rice and oatmeal. Apples are yummy: I eat one every day.  Eating beans and legumes is also very helpful.  Buy some dried lentils--they cook the fastest--and google some soup recipes.

But I found out the hard way not to salt anything I use it in. For example, I just made a batch of basmati rice with a wonderful flavor simply by adding a spoonful of this before heating the rice and water, and stirring. The clump dissolved fairly readily, especially as the materials began to heat. But when done it needed no added salt. I've found that even the \"reduced salt\" varieties I have of this brand are 'way salty, presumably as a preservative.

I tried it once. The bag is still clipped shut in the cupboard. The texture was gritty, and more stuck to the bowl than the popcorn. The color is more intense than the flavor. I didn't find it to be that cheese flavored popcorn I imagined.I told my wife to use it up in other dishes that could use a bit more cheese, but I don't think she is too thrilled to try it again.

Our iced tea actually tastes better with liquid stevia than it does with sugar. Surprising! Now I use it in a lot of cooking. When baking, use applesauce to replace the bulk of sugar (experiment with it) and then add stevia (we use one teaspoonful of clear liquid stevia for one cup of sugar).
